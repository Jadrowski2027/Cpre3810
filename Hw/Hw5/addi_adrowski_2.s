# addi_adrowski_2.s
# Test 2: Register operand handling (rd / rs1 decoding, x0, data dependencies)
#
# These cases check that addi reads from and writes to the correct
# registers: every rd/rs1 index decodes correctly, rd == rs1 works,
# writes to x0 are discarded, x0 always reads as 0, and back-to-back
# dependent addi's get the newest value (important once the processor is
# pipelined and needs forwarding). Only addi is used.
